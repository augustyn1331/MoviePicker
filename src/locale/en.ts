      'We worked on this project while we took an apprenticeship in mDevelopers. Project started with a group of 4 people, after a month half of the team got their first jobs so they had to quit developing the app, while we decided to stay in the project, add more features, clean up the code, therefore increasing our overall React Native skills. In this project we learned how to properly work with version control (GitHub) by creating feature branches, pull requests, reviewing our code. We got to know good coding practices, thanks to tips and code reviews from an experienced member working at the Software House that we took our apprenticeship. Tech stack used in this project: Typescript, React Native, Firebase, Redux Thunk Toolkit, Jest, React Testing Library, Enzyme, Formik, i18next, react-native-reanimated 2',
